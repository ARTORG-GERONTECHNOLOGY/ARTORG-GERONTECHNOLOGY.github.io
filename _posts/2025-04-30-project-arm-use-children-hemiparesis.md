title: Quantification of Daily Arm Use from IMU Data in Children with Hemiparesis
date: 2025-04-30 12:00:00
summary: Project Proposal
categories: gait-analysis
---

### Background:
A study of the Bern University Children’s Hospital (Inselspital) investigates the eﬀects and mechanisms of sensory aﬀerent electrostimulation with the goal to improve upper limb function of children suffering from spastic hemiparesis. To evaluate the daily arm use at different stages during the study, the participants wear two inertial measurement units (IMU).

### Description
You will develop an algorithm to quantify daily arm use from IMU data (e.g., asymmetry index) and classify movement activities.

### Material and Methods:
- Literature research
- Time series processing
- Machine learning

### Requirements:
- Good programming skills in python
- Good knowledge in time series analysis
- Basic knowledge in machine learning
- Good knowledge in statistics
