### Background:
Measuring the general health state of a person is of great interest in today’s approach towards personalized medicine. One option is to assess motor functions (i.e. gait) in long-term measurements.

### Description
You will search and use open-source algorithms that extract gait parameters (e.g., velocity, step length, numbers of steps) from accelerometer data. Your goal is to develop a python module that deploys algorithms to acceleration data from wrist-worn sensor and compare them.

### Material and Methods:
•	Literature research
•	Machine learning
•	Foundation models

### Requirements:
•	Good programming skills
•	Basic knowledge of data analysis
•	Basic knowledge of deep learning
