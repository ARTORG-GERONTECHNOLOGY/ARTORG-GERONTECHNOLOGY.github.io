### Background:
Neurological disorders often lead to significant impairments in upper limb movements. One approach to monitor the upper limb movement quality is markerless motion tracking. This technique utilizes a multi-camera system and deep neural networks to estimate the poses of distinct anatomical features over time.

### Description
You will annotate and train a markerless motion tracking model to quantify the upper limb movements of a person during different activities. The created model will then be validated by comparing the results with those of a marker-based motion tracking system.

### Material and Methods:
- Literature research
- Machine learning
- Time series analysis

### Requirements:
- Good programming skills in python
- Good knowledge in time series analysis
- Good knowledge in machine learning
- Good knowledge in statistics
