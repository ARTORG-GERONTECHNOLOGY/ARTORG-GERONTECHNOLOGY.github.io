title: Extracting Vital Sings from Seismic Signals
date: 2025-04-30 12:00:00
summary: Project Proposal
categories: sleep-analysis
---

### Background:
Traditional sleep monitoring using contact-based respiratory and heart rate sensors can be uncomfortable and lead to poor adherence. Analyzing micro-vibrations from the body, like seismocardiograms (SCG), offers a promising non-intrusive alternative for health assessment. There's a need for user-friendly technologies that can continuously monitor cardiac events during sleep without physical attachments.

### Description
You aim to develop algorithm(s) to extract vital-related activities – specifically heart rate, respiration rate, and body movement – from seismic signals of individuals lying in bed. This non-contact approach seeks to act as an alternative to the current wearable sleep monitoring devices.

### Material and Methods:
- Literature research
- Time series analysis
- Machine learning

### Requirements:
- Good programming skills in python
- Good knowledge in time series analysis
- Good knowledge in machine learning
- Good knowledge in statistics
