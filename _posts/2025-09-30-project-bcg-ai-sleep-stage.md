### Background:

Sleep disorders affect over 70 million people worldwide, significantly impacting quality of life and increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cognitive decline. While polysomnography (PSG) remains the gold standard for sleep monitoring, it is costly, confined to clinical settings, and requires cumbersome multi-electrode setups that disrupt natural sleep patterns. Ballistocardiography (BCG) offers a contactless alternative, using unobtrusive sensors under the mattress, that can be easily transferred to the home setting. These sensors detect microscopic chest movements generated by the heartâ€™s mechanical activity. Recent advances demonstrate that state- of-the-art algorithms achieve 89-90% accuracy in sleep stage classification. However, critical challenges remain: motion artifacts corrupt 11-15% of data, individual physiological variability reduces cross-population performance by 20-30%, and most importantly, existing algorithms lack validation in a population with sleep disorders. With the availability of open-source and private BCG large-scale datasets and advances in transformer architecture and zero-shot learning, there is a unique opportunity to develop accurate, efficient, and clinically useful solutions.

### Aim:

This thesis aims to develop and validate deep learning models, including transformer-based architecture, and adapt existing open source models, e.g., U-Sleep net, to achieve clinical-grade sleep stage classification from BCG signals. The architecture will be designed for real-world deployment.

### Material and Methods:

The project will leverage a recently collected dataset at Inselspital (Bern), comprising over 100 subjects with synchronized PSG-BCG recordings, supplemented by publicly available PSG-BCG paired recordings for validation (32 subjects, 212 nights).
The methodology involves:
1. Systematic literature review of state-of-the-art BCG sleep classification models.
2. Transfer learning adaptation of established architectures (e.g., U-Sleep Net) for raw BCG input.
3. Development of deep learning models, e.g. transformer-based architectures.
4. Comprehensive performance evaluation using Bland-Altman plots, epoch-by-epoch (30s) concordance, per-stage accuracy, and F1 scores against PSG ground truth.

### Nature of the Thesis:

60% algorithm development and optimization  
10% clinical validation and deployment testing
